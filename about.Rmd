I am working in the area of model-checking, specifically probabilistic model-checking for discrete-time Markov chains(DTMCs).Our recent work on model-checking HyperPCTL formulas using numerical approach has been accepted in iFM 2022 conference. I am currently working on model-checking partially-labeled Kripke structure using temporal logic CTL.
