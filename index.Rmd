My name is Eshita Zaman. I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science at Iowa State University.  Dr. Gianfranco Ciardo is my major professor. My research area is formal methods. I am working on verifying safety critical hyperproperties expressed in temporal logic HyperPCTL for discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs) and temporal logic HyperCSL for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). I am currently working on model-checking partially-labeled Kripke structure using temporal logic CTL.

## Recent updates
 + Our proposal "Model-checking partially labeled Kripke structure" has been accepted for summer seed funding.
 + Our work "HyperPCTL Model Checking by Probabilistic Decomposition" has been acceptem in iFM 2022 conference.
